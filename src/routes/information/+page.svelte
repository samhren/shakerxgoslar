	The Shaker Goslar exchange is the oldest partnership of a German and American school dating all
	the way back to 1978. Every year since, students have embarked on a life-changing journey with the
	Shaker Goslar Exchange Program, immersing in a unique cultural exchange, forging lasting
	friendships, broadening horizons, strengthening German skills, and creating memories that will
	last a lifetime. As participants in the Summer exchange program, the students spend over three and
	half weeks in Germany. While in Goslar the students stay with German host families who have
	students at the Ratsgymnasium (our partner school). There they will attend classes and take field
	trips to local sights such as the Wolfsburg Volkswagen Autostadt, the 400-meter deep Bergbau
	Museum, and the imperial residence Kaiserpfalz. During their stay in Germany, students will take
	two extended trips by train, the first to Berlin and the second to Munich. During these trips they
	will stay in youth hostels and hotels, visiting points of cultural interest, including world-class
	art museums, the remains of the Berlin Wall, and the famous Castle Neuschwanstein. Participating
	students earn one semester credit in German independent study.
